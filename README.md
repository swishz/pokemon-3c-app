## Tech stack

- To manage state using [Redux](https://redux.js.org/). Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps. It helps you write applications that behave consistently, run in different environments (client, server, and native), and are easy to test.
- This project uses a library call [Chackra-UI](https://chakra-ui.com/) to style components. Chakra UI is a simple, modular and accessible component library that gives you the building blocks you need to build your React applications.
